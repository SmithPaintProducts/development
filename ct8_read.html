    <p><strong>Smith&rsquo;s Cleaner &amp; Toughener &ldquo;CT-8&rdquo;</strong>Â is a dual purpose product designed for the preparation of exterior textured concrete surfaces to receive Smith&rsquo;s Decorative Concrete Products including Smith&rsquo;s Color Floor., Color Wall and Color Accents, Initially, CT-8 acts as a detergent to clean the concrete surface. Secondly, CT-8 toughens the surface of the concrete by interacting with weak spots created by un-reacted calcium hydroxide. CT-8 is biodegradable but should not be discharged as a powder or an undiluted cleaning solution directly into streams, ponds, lakes, etc.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <p>Dissolve 1 cup of CT-8 powder in each gallon of water. Warm water will help the powder to dissolve quickly. Liberally apply CT-8 to an area no larger than 10'x10'. Scrub the area with a rotary floor machine equipped with a nyla-grit scrub brush. Scrub in a pattern that causes the scrub brush to agitate the area at least four times. When scrubbing is completed, do not rinse until the CT-8 solution has been in contact with the concrete for at least 10 minutes but no more than 30 minutes. Rinsing is extremely important and should employ generous amounts of clean water with agitation via a floor machine or a very stiff bristled brush. Remove rinse water with wet vacuum. Continue to rinse surface with until vacuumed water is clear. An excellent indoor alternative for rinsing is the use of an automatic floor machine which applies rinse water, agitates the surface and vacuums the liquid. A pressure washer may be used on exterior substrates. Allow adequate time for the surface to dry before performing a tape test. The outcome of this test is important in determining the likelihood of a successful installation.</p><p>Perform the tape test as follows: Apply several strips of clear 2 inch packing tape to different areas of the floor. Rub the tape down tightly to the surface of the concrete using your thumb or the heel of your hand. Vigorously pull the tape off the substrate (best test: apply tape for 5 minutes). Hold the strips up to the light while looking for particles of concrete or inhibitors that have stuck to it. If there are very few particles, the floor is ready for stain application. If particles are present, the surface needs to be cleaned as described above. The tape test should be repeated after each cleaning to ensure that the surface of the concrete is both strong and clean enough for optimal stain adhesion.<br /><br />COVERAGE: 1 gallon solution of CT-8 treats 250-350 sq. ft. of concrete.</p><p><strong><a href="ct8_docs.html"><span style="color:#FFF200">Technical Documents</span></a></strong></p>
